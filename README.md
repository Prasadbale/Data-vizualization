Welcome to my personal repository where I showcase a collection of my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization projects in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These projects are a demonstration of my skills in exploring and visualizing data to gain insights, tell compelling stories, and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Project List

1. [World Instant Noodle Consumption](https://github.com/Prasadbale/EDA-Data-Visualization/tree/2997480435626f85e36ff9b5a6c57c0c9a5314a0/project1)
   - <span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Learning Data Visualization: Embark on a journey into data visualization with this educational project. Analyze noodle consumption data across 53 countries from 2018 to 2022 as a practical exercise in data visualization.
   - <span style="color: red">Hands-On Experience</span>: Gain valuable hands-on experience by working with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Explore how to effectively manipulate, analyze, and visualize real-world data to uncover meaningful insights.
   - <span style="color:red">Data-Driven Insights</span>: Discover the power of data-driven insights as you uncover the relationships between noodle consumption, population rank, and continent data. This project serves as a learning resource to enhance your data visualization skills and make informed decisions based on data analysis.
   - <span style="color:red">Tools</span>: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
